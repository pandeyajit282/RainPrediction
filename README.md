# Rain_Prediction

A project on predicting whether it will rain tomorrow or not by using the Rainfall in Australia dataset. This project is tested over different models like catboost, xgboost, random forest, support vector classifier, bagging classifier etc.. Out of these models bagging performed best giving an accuracy ofb 0.86 . In this, I also performed Hyperparameter tuning for all the models.
